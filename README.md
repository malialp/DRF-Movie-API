## Authentication

This API uses Token authentication to authenticate users. To obtain a token, send a POST request to the `/auth` endpoint with your username and password:

```http
POST /auth
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "username": "your-username",
    "password": "your-password"
}
```

The server will respond with a JSON object containing your token:

```json
{
  "token": "your-token"
}
```

Include the token in subsequent requests by including the `Authorization` header with the value `Token your-token`:

```http
GET  /movies/
Authorization: Token your-token
```
